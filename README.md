# Notes2Notes


**Project Description:** Notes2Notes is a digital journal where you can type out your thoughts and emotions for each day (as you would when writing in a traditional journal), and the app will analyze your writing with the songs in your Spotify to generate a playlist of songs that best reflect your emotions/thoughts using song lyrics.
